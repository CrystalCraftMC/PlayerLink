PlayerLink is a simple, lightweight plugin designed to make sharing URLs
related to your server easier. With the mere typing of a command, a user
can instantly be given a URL to whatever you set! No longer will you have
to pump a URL through an announcer plugin and no longer will you have to
have the URL in the clipboard for when new players join your server. It's
all there for them. Whether it be a website, voting page, Facebook page,
Twitter page, YouTube account... we have you covered.

In addition to just showing the link, every time a player uses one of
these commands, it will be broadcast across the chat, to let others know
that the command is there for them to use. All it takes is one player to
use the command, and everybody online now knows about it! This is only an
optional feature, though.
