PlayerLink

PlayerLink is a simple, lightweight plugin designed to make sharing URLs
related to your server easier. With the mere typing of a command, a user
can instantly be given a URL to whatever you set! No longer will you have
to pump a URL through an announcer plugin and no longer will you have to
have the URL in the clipboard for when new players join your server. It's
all there for them. Whether it be a website, voting page, Facebook page,
Twitter page, YouTube account... we have you covered.

In addition to just showing the link, every time a player uses one of
these commands, it will be broadcast across the chat, to let others know
that the command is there for them to use. All it takes is one player to
use the command, and everybody online now knows about it! This is only an
optional feature, though.

PlayerLink was originally developed by xBrandonGordon, a 14-year-old
programmer with a goal to become better at Java. After the plugin was
abandoned in April 2013, the plugin was picked up by me, jflory7, because
I still thought the plugin was useful.

I began coding in June 2013 after taking a three-week programming course
for video games as part of the Duke TiP program. I'm taking this project
on as a chance for me to become more fluent in Java, and to help breathe
life into an abandoned plugin.
